## The web has been deployed in Netlify

## Description
This project is a web application that utilizes the Rick and Morty API to display character information and episodes dynamically. Developed with Next.js and React.js, it features a responsive design and utilizes server-side rendering for improved performance and SEO benefits.

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-rendered applications, which helps in achieving faster page loads and a seamless user experience.
- **React.js**: Used for building the user interface with state management and component-based architecture.
- **React Query**: Utilized for managing server state in the application, enabling efficient data fetching, caching, and synchronization. It simplifies building complex user interfaces that depend on real-time data, reducing the need for boilerplate code and improving performance.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Applied for styling the application, providing a utility-first approach that accelerates the development process.
- **Rick and Morty API**: Integrates this third-party API to fetch and display data about characters and episodes, showcasing asynchronous data fetching techniques.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Data Fetching**: Characters and episodes are fetched in real-time from the Rick and Morty API. The use of React Query's `keepPreviousData` feature ensures that data transitions are seamless, maintaining previous page data visible while new data is being fetched, thus enhancing user experience during pagination.
- **Skeleton Screens**: Implementation of skeleton screens provides a visual placeholder while data is loading, significantly enhancing the user experience by reducing the perceived wait times and keeping the interface responsive.

## Testing
Comprehensive testing has been conducted to ensure the reliability and functionality of the application. This includes:
- **Component Tests**: Verifying that each component renders correctly and interacts properly with user inputs.
- **Hook Tests**: Ensuring that custom hooks manage state and side effects as expected, maintaining application integrity.
